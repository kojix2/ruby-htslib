# Scripts for the developer

This is the directory for the developer.
Tools used by kojix2 to maintain ruby-htslib.

If the maintainer of ruby-htslib changes from kojix2 to someone else,
it is NOT necessary or even recommended to maintain these tools.
Future maintainers should use their favorite tools.

Of course, they can take over some of my scripts.

Note: Use `gnu-sed` and `ggrep` on macOS.
