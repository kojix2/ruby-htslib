# Summary

We present ruby-htslib and HTS.cr.

* Code of ruby-htslib : [https://github.com/kojix2/ruby-htslib](https://github.com/kojix2/ruby-htslib)
* Code of HTS.cr : [https://github.com/bio-cr/hts.cr](https://github.com/bio-cr/hts.cr)

# Statement of need

Recent advances in genome research have accumulated a lot of biological information. the Ruby language is mainly used for developing web applications, but until now there has been no way to access HTS files with the Ruby language. The BioRuby [@goto2010] project does not provide access to HTS files. Ruby-htslib is an htslib [@bonfield2021] binding that provides access to HTS files from the Ruby language and provides a means to develop bioinformatics web applications.
